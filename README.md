Racket `mutt` API.
Installing this package helps setup `mutt`. Then you can send emails:

```
#lang racket/base
(require mutt)

(mutt "Listen, Boy"
      #:subject "My First Love Story"
      #:to "geegeegeegee@baby.baby")
```

NOTE: this package does not currently support Windows systems.


Install

First install the free [`mutt`](http://www.mutt.org/) email client.
It's on [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and your local Linux package manager.

Second, install this package from the [Racket package server](http://pkgs.racket-lang.org)

```
$ raco pkg install mutt
```

or Github (the `./` is necessary).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bennn/racket-mutt
$ raco pkg install ./racket-mutt
```

When prompted, enter your email address and real name.


API
---

- `(mutt message #:to recipient #:subject subject #:cc cc #:bcc bcc)`
  Send `message` to the address `recipient` with subject `subject`.
  Send carbon-copies to the `cc` and blind carbon copies to the `bcc`.
- `(mutt* message #:to* recipients)`
  Similar to `mutt`, but send the same message to a list of recipients.
  Accepts the same options too, except for `#:to`.

See the documentation for more: <http://docs.racket-lang.org/mutt/index.html>


FAQ
--- 

#### Q. Can I accept certificates on the command line?

No. Run `mutt` on the command line to manually approve certificates.
(Make sure to "always accept" the certificate.)
